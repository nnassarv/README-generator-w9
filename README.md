## Description

The first version of my portfolio website was created as the homework assignment on Week 2 of the bootcamp.
It has been updated as part of the week 8 homework assignment.

> ### Some of the updates include:
- Using Bootstrap as a CSS framework
- Update the portfolio projects to real assignments and projects
- Refactor the website


## Design
For this website I used a simple color pallet with contrasting colors and dark background.
The first version of the site was done completely with CSS.
The second version is done with **Bootstrap** to help make it ***mobile-first***

> ### Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap + Bootstrap JS
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome


## Mobile first
The first version of the website was made using media screens to make the app responsive to mobile or smaller screens. The second version addresses these requirements by leveraging Bootstrap's column + row framework.

> ### Here are some screenshots of the new version
- This is the portfolio improved with some navigation and visual guides as the user scrolls through the page:

- This is a view of a smaller screen (mobile) where the navigation has been compacted into a hamburger menu and still the "scrollspy" indicates to the reader the current location.
